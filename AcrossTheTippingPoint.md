# Vision

The world is changing too fast. We can't understand what is going on and if you try too hard you go insane.

Rapid technological, economic, political and cultural changes are sweeping society, that will re-define the world as we know it, demanding us to re-define our relationships with the society and each other.

Drawing on our backgrounds in the natural sciences, social sciences, the arts and technology, we will grapple with these interconnected changes happening around us, try to make models to understand the current events and the future, and understand the impacts on the fabric of society, our communities, families and sense of self.

Our goal is to play a small part in the contribution to a broader dialogue, that we should all be having, that defines the future for us all.

# Structure and format
Each episode will be one hour will be a fun, self-organised discussion around a common question, containing three individuals with various viewpoints trying to find common principles to make sense of the madness. 

Each episode will be shared on youtube and streaming services

# Organisation
We have a partnership model, we share the organisation and the jobs between partners in a fair way. Between partners, decision making processes are democratic and flat with each individual having a chance to have there voices heard.

This is for fun, although if we build a large audience we could consider a donation model (e.g. Patreon).
